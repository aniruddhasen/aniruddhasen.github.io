I am Aniruddha Sen, a PhD student in the Computer Science department at the University of Texas at Austin. I am broadly interested in quantum computing and theoretical computer science.

During my undergraduate, I worked under [Prof. Don Towsley](https://www.cics.umass.edu/faculty/directory/towsley_donald) as part of the [ACQuIRe Lab](https://acquire.cs.umass.edu) at UMass Amherst. As part of my Honors thesis, I was also supervised by [Prof. Stefan Krastanov](https://lab.krastanov.org) and [Dr. Kenneth Goodenough](https://sites.google.com/view/kdgoodenough/home). I recently spent a summer in Urbana-Champaign, as part of [LPNA](http://lpna.cs.illinois.edu) at UIUC, working under [Prof. Edgar Solomonik](https://solomonik.cs.illinois.edu).
