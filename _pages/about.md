I am Aniruddha Sen, a PhD student in the Computer Science department at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu). I am broadly interested in quantum computing and theoretical computer science.

I graduated _summa cum laude_ from the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu) with a B.S. degree double majoring in computer science and mathematics. During my undergraduate, I worked under [Prof. Don Towsley](https://www.cics.umass.edu/faculty/directory/towsley_donald) as part of the [ACQuIRe Lab](https://acquire.cs.umass.edu) at UMass. For my Honors thesis, I was also co-supervised by [Prof. Stefan Krastanov](https://lab.krastanov.org) and [Dr. Kenneth Goodenough](https://sites.google.com/view/kdgoodenough/home). I recently spent a summer in Urbana-Champaign, as part of [LPNA](http://lpna.cs.illinois.edu) at [UIUC](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu), working under [Prof. Edgar Solomonik](https://solomonik.cs.illinois.edu).

A detailed list of my projects, experiences, publications, and awards can be found in my [CV](https://aniruddhasen.github.io/files/cv.pdf).
